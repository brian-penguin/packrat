# Packrat

Hopefully the first of many learn-a-long trails for building and learning applications

### Getting Going:

#### Install Deps
 Make sure [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) is installed for your clojure deps and install node / npm (however you prefer) which will come with npx a package runner

First `npm install` to get our build dependencies from the NPM registry


#### Build the Project
Then run `npx shadow-cljs compile app` to build the app into the `public` directory.

You can also "watch" the application to get live reloads just swap `watch` for `compile` in the previous command.
